# ibm-bikini-chitchat-watson-assistant
Starter package for Watson Assistant application - chit-chat-bot with Node-Red 
The goal of this lab is to build an end-to-end application which can interact with the Watson Assistant Service to get a basic understanding of a Chat-Bot Application and a user dialog with ‘AI based service’.

Implementing all parts mentioned above will not be possible in the time available for this lab.

•	Therefore, we recommend starting with the Watson Assistant Service which you can use to build a basic dialog. How to launch the tool and get started is described in the following chapter. After completing this part, you will have a basic understanding for the Watson Assistant Service and you can test different user dialogs directly in the Launch Tool environment.
For details see Chapter 2 

•	To move forward we want to build an ‘end-to-end’ application for which you need an interface program to interact with the Watson Assistant passing questions from an end-user to the service and handling the return information of the service. This can be done in many different ways. Here we will use the Node-Red environment but you can also use e.g. ‘Serverless function’ like OpenWhisk or IBM Functions. You can check out my other projects on GitHub where I provided a REACT Application using IBM Functions
•	
•	A sample function is available on Github which you can use to interact with your Watson Assistant Service from step one.
